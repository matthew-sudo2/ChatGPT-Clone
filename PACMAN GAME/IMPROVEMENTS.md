# 🎮 Pac-Man Game Improvements

## ✅ Recent Enhancements

### 🔧 **Fixed Wall Collision Issues**
- **Improved Collision Detection**: Added corner-based collision checking to prevent Pac-Man from getting stuck in or passing through walls
- **Margin System**: Added safety margins to ensure smooth movement around tight corners
- **Bounds Checking**: Enhanced boundary validation to prevent out-of-bounds errors

### 🎨 **Sprite System Integration**
- **Sprite Manager**: Created a comprehensive sprite management system that can use the official Pac-Man sprite sheet
- **Fallback Graphics**: If sprites aren't available, the game falls back to the original geometric shapes
- **Animation Support**: Proper sprite animation for Pac-Man's mouth and ghost movement
- **Asset-Ready**: The game is now ready to use your `Arcade - Pac-Man - General Sprites.png` file

### 🏗️ **Enhanced Architecture**
- **Modular Collision System**: Each entity now has its own collision detection method
- **Improved Level Manager**: Better maze rendering with visual enhancements
- **Sprite Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback to simple graphics if sprite files are missing

## 🎯 **Key Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Wall Penetration Fix**
```python
def _can_move_to(self, x, y, game_manager):
    """Check all four corners of entity's bounding box"""
    margin = 2  # Prevents getting stuck
    corners = [
        (x + margin, y + margin),
        (x + tile_size - margin, y + margin),
        (x + margin, y + tile_size - margin),
        (x + tile_size - margin, y + tile_size - margin)
    ]
    return all(not game_manager.level_manager.is_wall(cx, cy) for cx, cy in corners)
```

### 2. **Sprite Integration**
- Automatic sprite extraction from sprite sheets
- Proper scaling and positioning
- Animation frame management
- Color-based sprite selection for different ghost types

### 3. **Enhanced Collision Detection**
- Center-point collision for dots
- Radius-based collision detection
- Improved ghost-to-wall collision
- Better tunnel detection

## 🚀 **How to Use the Sprite Sheet**

1. **Place the sprite file** in `assets/images/pacman_sprites.png`
2. **The game will automatically detect and use it**
3. **If not found, falls back to simple graphics**

## 🎮 **Game Now Features**

- ✅ **No wall clipping** - Pac-Man can't pass through walls anymore
- ✅ **Smooth movement** - Better corner navigation
- ✅ **Sprite support** - Ready for your PNG assets
- ✅ **Enhanced visuals** - Better wall borders and graphics
- ✅ **Improved AI** - Ghosts also use the enhanced collision system

## 🔄 **Testing the Fixes**

Run the game and test:
1. **Wall Collision**: Try moving into walls - Pac-Man should stop smoothly
2. **Corner Navigation**: Move around tight corners - should be smoother
3. **Dot Collection**: Eating dots should feel more responsive
4. **Ghost Movement**: Ghosts should move more naturally around walls

The game is now much more stable and ready for your sprite assets! 🎉
